# **Clustering Assignment: A Comparative Study of Clustering Algorithms**

This project presents a comparative analysis of various clustering algorithms, utilizing different data pre-processing methods and cluster sizes. The experiments were conducted on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the results are documented through comprehensive tables, visualizations, and insights — all within a Google Colab notebook.
